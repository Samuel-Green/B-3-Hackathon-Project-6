abstract = {Measuring biodiversity is a key issue in ecology to guarantee effective indicators of ecosystem health at different spatial and time scales. However, estimating biodiversity from field observations might present difficulties related to costs and time needed. Moreover, a continuous data update for biodiversity monitoring purposes might be prohibitive. From this point of view, remote sensing represents a powerful tool since it allows to cover wide areas in a relatively low amount of time. One of the most common indicators of biodiversity is Shannon's entropy H′, which is strictly related to environmental heterogeneity, and thus to species diversity. However, Shannon's entropy might show drawbacks once applied to remote sensing data, since it considers relative abundances but it does not explicitly account for distances among pixels' numerical values. In this paper we propose the use of Rao's Q applied to remotely sensed data, providing a straightforward R-package function to calculate it in 2D systems. We will introduce the theoretical rationale behind Rao's index and then provide applied examples based on the proposed R function.},

abstract = {The opening of large archives of satellite data such as LANDSAT, MODIS and the SENTINELs has given researchers unprecedented access to data, allowing them to better quantify and understand local and global land change. The need to analyze such large data sets has led to the development of automated and semi-automated methods for satellite image time series analysis. However, few of the proposed methods for remote sensing time series analysis are available as open source software. In this paper we present the R package dtwSat. This package provides an implementation of the time-weighted dynamic time warping method for land cover mapping using sequence of multi-band satellite images. Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant results in time series analysis. Package dtwSat is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contributes to making methods for satellite time series analysis available to a larger audience. The package supports the full cycle of land cover classification using image time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualizing and assessing the results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a time-weighted version of the dynamic time warping (DTW) method for land-use and land-cover classification using remote sensing image time series. Methods based on DTW have achieved significant results in time-series data mining. The original DTW method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classification. It disregards the temporal range when finding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a specific phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classifier needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original DTW method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classification using DTW. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover.},

ABSTRACT = {With the ability to capture daily imagery of Earth at very high spatial resolutions, commercial smallsats are emerging as a key resource for the remote sensing community. Planet (Planet Labs, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) operates the largest constellation of Earth imaging smallsats, which have been capturing multispectral imagery for consumer use since 2016. Use of these images is growing in the remote sensing community, but the variation in radiometric and geometric quality compared to traditional platforms (i.e., Landsat, MODIS, etc.) means the images are not always ‘analysis ready’ upon download. Neglecting these variations can impact derived products and analyses. Users also must contend with constantly evolving technology, which improves products but can create discrepancies across sensor generations. This communication provides a technical review of Planet’s PlanetScope smallsat data streams and extant literature to provide practical considerations to the remote sensing community for utilizing these images in remote sensing research. Radiometric and geometric issues for researchers to consider are highlighted alongside a review of processing completed by Planet and innovations being developed by the user community to foster the adoption and use of these images for scientific applications.},

abstract = {Rewilding is increasingly considered as an option for environmental regeneration, with potential for enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services. So far, however, there is little practical information on how to gauge the benefits and limitations of rewilding schemes on ecosystem composition, structure and functioning. To address this knowledge gap, we explored how satellite remote sensing can contribute to informing the monitoring and evaluation of rewilding projects, using the Knepp estate as a case study. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impacts of rewilding as an ecological regeneration strategy on landscape structure and functioning over several decades. Results show significant changes in land cover distribution over the past 20 years inside rewilded areas in the Knepp estate, with a 41.4% decrease in areas with brown agriculture and grass, a roughly sixfold increase in areas covered with shrubs, and a 40.9% increase in areas with trees; vegetation in the rewilded areas also showed a widespread increase in annual primary productivity. Changes in land cover and primary productivity are particularly pronounced in the part of the estate that began its rewilding journey with a period of large herbivore absence. Altogether, our approach clearly demonstrates how freely available satellite data can (1) provide vital insights about long-term changes in ecosystem composition, structure and functioning, even for small, heterogeneous and relatively intensively used landscapes; and (2) help deepen our understanding of the impacts of rewilding on vegetation distribution and dynamics, in ways that complement existing ground-based studies on the impacts of this approach on ecological communities.},

abstract = {Abstract Up-to-date land cover maps are important for biodiversity monitoring as they are central to habitat and ecosystem distribution assessments. Satellite remote sensing is a key technology for generating these maps. Until recently, land cover mapping has been limited to static approaches, which have primarily led to the production of either global maps at coarse spatial resolutions or geographically restricted maps at high spatial resolutions. The recent availability of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite image time series (SITS) which provide access to high spatial and very high temporal resolutions, is a game changer, offering opportunities to map land cover using both temporal and spatial information. These data moreover open interesting perspectives for land cover mapping based on data combination approach. However, the usefulness of combining dense time series (more than 30 images per year) and data combination approaches to map natural vegetation has so far not been assessed. To address this gap, this contribution tests the idea that the combined consideration of optical and radar data combination and time series analyses can significantly improve natural vegetation mapping in the Pendjari National Park, a Sahelian savanna protected area in Benin. Results highlight that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 SITS performs as well as Sentinel-2 SITS alone in terms of classification accuracy. Land cover maps are however qualitatively better when considering the data combination approach. Our results also clearly show that the use of dense/hypertemporal optical time series significantly improves classification outcomes compared to using multitemporal only a few images per year) or monotemporal data. Altogether, this work thus demonstrates the ability of dense SITS to improve discrimination of natural vegetation types using information on their phenology, leading to more detailed and more reliable maps for environmental management.},

abstract = {Phenology, the timing of annually recurrent reproductive biological events, provides a critical signal of climate variability and change effects on plants. Considerable work over the past five decades has quantified the extent to which plant phenophases are responding to local changes in temperature and rainfall. Originally undertaken through the analysis of ground-based phenological observations, the discipline has more recently included phenophase indicators from satellite images and digital repeat photography. With research advances it has become evident that the responses of plant phenology to climate variability and change are both location- and species-specific. The extent to which plants are affected by changes in temperature and rainfall, their intrinsic adaptation capacity, will ultimately determine the potential for sustained ecological stability and food security. We review methodological approaches to plant phenological-climate change over time, analyse the regions and phenophases for which climate variability demonstrates a clear causal role, and finally reflect on the applications of phenological climate change investigations in broader biogeographical contexts.},
